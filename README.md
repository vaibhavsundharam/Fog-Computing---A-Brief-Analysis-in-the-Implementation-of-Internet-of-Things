# Fog-Computing---A-Brief-Analysis-in-theImplementation-of-Internet-of-Things
The advancement of the Internet of Things has revolutionized the world we live in today. With this expansion, there comes a need for methods that can handle the vast amount of data being generated by the IoT. Fog computing is one such paradigm. It mitigates high-latency and provides better bandwidth utilization, thereby increasing agility and productivity of a network. This paper starts with a brief review of what fog computing is, its components and architecture. Next, to demonstrate the superiority of fog-computing as compared to cloud-based infrastructures, we developed an accident detection application to compare the difference in the response time of fog and cloud. We monitored the response time as well as data usage and have presented plots for the same. Please refer the report for more details.
